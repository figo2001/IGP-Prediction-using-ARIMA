# Time Series Prediction using ARIMA

This repository contains the implementation of time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. ARIMA is a popular statistical method for modeling and forecasting univariate time series data.

## Introduction

Time series prediction involves forecasting future values based on previously observed values. In this project, we use the ARIMA model to predict future points in a time series dataset. ARIMA is a combination of three components:

1. **AR (AutoRegressive)**: The relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations.
2. **I (Integrated)**: The differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary.
3. **MA (Moving Average)**: The relationship between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

## ARIMA Model

The ARIMA model is represented as ARIMA(p, d, q):
- **p**: The number of lag observations (AR terms).
- **d**: The number of times the raw observations are differenced to make the series stationary.
- **q**: The size of the moving average window (MA terms).

This project involves:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, making data stationary).
- Model identification using ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function).
- Fitting the ARIMA model and making future predictions.
- Evaluating the model using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

For demonstration purposes, this project uses a [sample time series dataset](link to dataset).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/arima-time-series-prediction.git
cd arima-time-series-prediction
```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the ARIMA model for time series prediction, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is in the correct format (CSV, with a time index and value column).

2. **Train the model**: Run the following command to train the ARIMA model on your dataset:

```bash
python arima_model.py --input dataset.csv
```

3. **Predict future values**: After training, the model will generate predictions for future time steps, and you can visualize the results.


## Results

The ARIMA model is evaluated based on forecasting accuracy. You can visualize both the historical data and future predictions. Example results include:

- Time series plot showing the actual data and the predicted future values.
- Error metrics such as RMSE and MAE to evaluate model performance.
